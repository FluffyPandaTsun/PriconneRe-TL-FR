幽霊の出やすい季節=Ghost-Prone Season
夏は幽霊の出やすい季節ですから、\nこういった場所で霊障が相次ぐのも無理はありません。\n……が、正直もっと過ごしやすい季節に出ていただきたいものです。=Summer is the season when ghosts are more likely to appear, so it's not surprising that there are many spiritual disturbances in places like this. However, to be honest, it would be better if they appeared during a more comfortable season.

ドＭのわくわく心霊体験=A masochist's exciting psychic experience
幽霊ですかぁ～……あまり霊感のようなものはないので\nよく分かりませんが、ナ、ナニかされたらクウカでも分かるかと……♪\n少しはお役に立てるとよいのですが～……ぐふふ。=Ghosts, huh...? I don't have much of a spiritual sense, so I'm not sure, but I-I think even Kuuka would understand if you did something to me... ♪ I hope I can be of some help... Gufufu.
